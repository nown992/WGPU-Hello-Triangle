This is a WGPU hello triangle example.

This is using winit 0.30.3 which has newer window handles which was a breaking change from 0.29.
This example is for personal reference to go back to in future projects. 

As the plan long term will be using for desktop apps rather than using WASM for web. i have opted to use TOKIO for threads. 
If you see this example and want to use it for web you will have to swap this out.
